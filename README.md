# 🌍 CO₂ Emissions Across the Globe  
### Global CO₂ Emission Analytics using Power BI  

**Domain:** Visual Analytics | Business Intelligence  
**Tool:** Microsoft Power BI  
 

---

## 📌 Project Overview  

This project delivers an **end-to-end CO₂ emission analytics dashboard** built using **Power BI**, designed to convert complex global environmental and economic data into **clear, actionable insights**.

The analysis integrates **CO₂ emissions, GDP, population, energy consumption, and income classification** to help stakeholders understand **where emissions originate, how they evolve, and how they relate to economic growth** at global, regional, and country levels.

## 📊 Dashboard Overview  

### 📄 1. CO₂ Emission – Globally  
**Purpose:** High-level global snapshot of emissions and economic indicators  
**Highlights:**  
- KPIs: Total CO₂, CO₂ per GDP, Total GDP, Total Population  
- Regional comparison of emissions and economy  
- Global greenhouse gas composition  

**Key Insight:**  
Asia dominates population and GDP, while Europe shows higher CO₂ intensity per economic output.

---

### 📄 2. Region-wise CO₂ per Capita  
**Purpose:** Regional and geographic comparison of emission intensity  
**Highlights:**  
- CO₂ per capita distribution across regions  
- Interactive world map with drillthrough to country-level details  
- Population band comparison  

**Key Insight:**  
Regions with higher population density show wider emission dispersion, with Asia and Europe leading.

---

### 📄 3. Country Emission Detail *(Drillthrough Page)*  
**Purpose:** Deep-dive analysis for individual countries  
**Highlights:**  
- Country-wise CO₂ and GDP trends by year  
- GDP contribution gauge  
- Year-based emission comparison  

**Key Insight:**  
High-GDP countries contribute disproportionately higher CO₂ emissions, especially in recent decades.

---

### 📄 4. Country-wise Population  
**Purpose:** Understand population distribution and its relationship with emissions  
**Highlights:**  
- Country-level population comparison  
- Regional population dominance analysis  

**Key Insight:**  
Population concentration significantly influences total emission contribution across regions.

---

### 📄 5. CO₂ by Income Group  
**Purpose:** Compare emissions across economic categories  
**Highlights:**  
- CO₂ per GDP by income group  
- Emission distribution across income levels  

**Key Insight:**  
High-income countries emit more CO₂ per unit of economic activity compared to lower-income groups.

---

### 📄 6. Income Group Detail *(Drillthrough Page)*  
**Purpose:** Drilldown into country-level details within income groups  
**Highlights:**  
- Country-wise GDP and CO₂ contribution  
- Region-wise economic distribution  
- GDP performance gauge  

**Key Insight:**  
Europe dominates GDP contribution, followed by Asia as a major economic and emission contributor.

---

## 🔍 Key Insights Summary  

- Economic growth and CO₂ emissions are strongly correlated  
- Developed economies show higher emission intensity  
- Emission responsibility is uneven across regions and income groups  
- Drillthrough analysis improves transparency and clarity
